# 🚦 Traffic Light Simulation – Frontend Mini Project
An interactive **Traffic Light Simulation** created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focused on delivering a **clean UI** with **automated light transitions**.  
This project was built to sharpen frontend development skills — especially working with the **DOM, timers, and dynamic styling**.
## 🎯 Project Objective
> Build a visually appealing and functional simulation of a traffic signal using core frontend technologies.
- ✅ Design a clean and responsive **Traffic Light UI**
- ✅ Implement **automatic color change** using `setInterval`
- ✅ Apply **modular CSS styling** for visual clarity
- ✅ Understand **DOM manipulation** and UI control with JavaScript

## 🧠 What I Learned
- 🎨 Styling with CSS to create real-world UI components
- ⏱ Using `setInterval()` and timing functions in JS
- 💡 Dynamic class toggling and element styling
- 🧱 Structuring UI with semantic HTML
